better structure might be:

Loop:->
			-
			->ascend/input encodes->
			->(jump in here with rgb mask, right after encoding text), modify image in whatever way

			>train/loss function


Or maybe swap to a system where its all decoupled as modular "passes" (predefined series of functions with parameters in a list that are executed in sequence) are able to be combined however you wish, with maybe different passes defined for different image areas
This would also allow you to add undo/other trickery

Currently image areas are defined by colour channels, but theres no reason they couldnt be standardised to simply be coordinates on the image instead. Or allow for both, with coordinates able to refer to any image file (with options to resize to match input before calculating)
Could combine way more prompt boundaries and overlapping ones easier too, like define stuff for the whole image but then minor alterations on subimages that come up

+ Automate values

Examples of passes:
Zoom/rotation/pan/literally any image processing
clip pass (style transfer), clip pass (modify subject), clip pass (macro shapes) or some shit
